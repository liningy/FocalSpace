here you put the bullet source files. I'm not including them because they are updated daily.

1. download the latest bullet code from http://www.bulletphysics.com/
2. copy the 'src' folder from your downloaded package to here
3. rename that newly copied 'src' folder to 'bullet'

so now you should have

ofxBulletPhysics / lib / bullet and inside that:
  btBulletCollisionCommon.h
  btBulletDynamicsCommon.h
  etc.

I've also included a sample screenshot of the folder structure
