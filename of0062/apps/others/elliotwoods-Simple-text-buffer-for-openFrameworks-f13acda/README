Very simple text input.
http://github.com/elliotwoods/Simple-text-buffer-for-openFrameworks

Supports:
* Range of standard ascii input keys
* left,right to move cursor
* delete,backspace

Does not support:
* mouse select
* shift select
* clipboard
* up,down key navigation

Generally for simple tasks like when you want to save something with a filename (suggest changing the behavious of OF_KEY_RETURN to save)

There are 2 branches on the github:
* very simple - not object oriented. Chop and change as you like
https://github.com/elliotwoods/Simple-text-buffer-for-openFrameworks/tree/VerySimple
* ofx style - in a seperate class, but still suggest you chop and change as you like.

Since i presume most people will be changing the code to their own needs, i'm not suggesting that this is a real ofx extension, but instead some code that you can start with and hack with.
